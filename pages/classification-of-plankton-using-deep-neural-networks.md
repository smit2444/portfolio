In a recent course on Neural Networks and Deep Learning, a group project focused on classifying plankton using deep neural networks. <br> The project involved several key stages:</p>
<ul class="item_des">
    <li class="item_des"><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Executed comprehensive data preprocessing for the IFCB plankton dataset, which included rescaling over 1 million grayscale images to 225x225 pixels. I automated data organization and cleaning processes and addressed class imbalances to ensure the dataset was of the highest quality for training.</li>
    <li class="item_des"><strong>Model Development:</strong> Developed an automated plankton identification system utilizing a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network. This approach allowed us to efficiently process large volumes of images, significantly enhancing classification accuracy and reducing the need for extensive manual labeling.</li>
</ul>
<p class="user_des">The project not only improved our understanding of deep learning techniques but also demonstrated the effectiveness of neural networks in real-world applications, particularly in automating and scaling the classification of large datasets.</p>

<p class="user_des">The more details about this projects can be found in the report.</p>
